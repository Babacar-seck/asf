                    p
                    | We got our workshop back, more beautiful than before,
                    | bigger too, but that is due to the loss of furniture.
                    | In reality, thanks to the new wall, the room has shrunk by a couple of inches.
                    p
                    | The new beginning made it possible to redefine the space, with Doug's large table as a work table,
                    | a long board in front of the window, as a desk or counter for association meetings or exhibitions.
                    p  And the walls ... even more walls than before with space for very large paintings, like this Doug canvas, 250 x 75 cm.
