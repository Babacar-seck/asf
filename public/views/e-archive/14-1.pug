                h3 Mary Quartarone "Blue Woman"
                P Mary Quartarone's art springs from her spirituality and belief in God. Her images are drawn from deep visions that reflect the soul and the heart of her inner world. Mary is living with metastatic breast cancer and she often paints her future as she journeys with this disease. Her inspirations come from the colours and shapes of nature and the instinctive mind. In addition, she often does soul portraiture. Mary lives in Mississauga, Ontario Canada with her husband of 34 years. She has two grown sons and in addition to her art, is pursuing the development of a new model of child care to support families in the 21st century.
