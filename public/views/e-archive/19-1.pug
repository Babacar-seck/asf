        h3 New site - new offer - trainees
        p From April 2019, we are preparing a complete change of the website. 
        p 
            | This site has changed many times since the first version in 2000. This time, we change the technology,
            | to make the site dynamic and responsive, to be comfortable to consult on a mobile and on or a big screen.
            br
            | Our website includes an archive of events for almost 20 years and sites created for our members during the same period.
            | It will take some time to translate everything into the current Internet language first and then into several languages.
            | The last step will add a space for members to discuss art and share their experiences.
        p To facilitate this project, the association Artists Without Borders will now occupy trainees in development, web integration or graphics.
