# asf - Project of website  migration

joint work repository for asf members

AsF stands for Artistes sans Fronti√®res, a no profit international artists' association founded in the South of France nearly 20 years ago.

This project grew  nearly over night from a wishful thought during my own training, "We should remake the association's website from scratch", to a full blown dev JS project with several contributors.

In a way, I consider it still as a training exemple, as we develop the organisation on the go - the latter became necessary when S, a training collegue, offered to continue contributing from afar, working on single artist's websites, when he has a moment to spare.

Z, an intern from the next promotion joined the team for a few months. He migrates the archive of 20 year's of events and photo reports and will develop the navigation through this huge chapter.

I sign for the structure, backend and db. The latout is yet undefined and other languages will follow. H.
