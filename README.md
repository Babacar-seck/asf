# asf - Project of website  migration

joint work repository for asf members

AsF stands for Artistes sans Fronti√®res, a no profit international artists' association founded in the South of France nearly 20 years ago.

This project grew nearly over night from a wishful thought during my own training, "We should rewrite the association's website from scratch", to a full blown dev JS project with several contributors.

S, who took part on the planning and first set-up as an intern,  offered to continue working for the association from afar. He creates single artist's websites, when he has a moment to spare.

Z, an intern from the next promotion joined the team for a few months. He migrates the archive of 20 year's of events and photo reports and will develop the navigation and routes through this huge chapter.

I sign for the project management, most of the backend and db. The layout is adapted on the go and other languages will follow. H.
